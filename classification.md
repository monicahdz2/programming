## **Silver** Exam stylee questions

### 1.-Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level languages when writing programs?

This is because high-level developed can be used on a variety of different machines;  however, they are not as efficient as low-level languages. 

### 2.-What is machine code?

Is the elemental language of computers. It is read by the CPU, is composed of digital binary numbers and looks like a very long sequence of zeros and ones. 

### 3.-Give an example of a high-level language?

Python, visual basic, java, sql, c++, c, c#, JavaScript and others
--------------------------------------------

## **Gold** Answer the following questions

### 1.- Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?
-----------------------------------------------------
**Low-level**
- have a limited number of programming constructs, with selections and uterations being performed using compare and branch instructions
- To write code at the processor level we can use assembly language that is specific to a processor architecture or family of processor.
- It is also used by people in cases of debugging code to determine exactly what's going on but can only generally be done by people with very specialist knowledge.
-----------------------------------------------------
**High-level**
- the code details how a problem is to be solved rather that giving instructions on how the computer will provede a solution.
- can be used on a variety of different machines;
- Here are a few features that high-level languages have


### 2.-What does a translator do?

There are three types of translator programs:
-----------------------------------------------------
**Interpreters**
- The programming language translates the source code into machine code one command line at a time and immediately executes them.
- A long, complex program will take a considerably more time to execute if it is being interpreted.	
- this makes interpreted code slower to run that compiled code, but it shows any errors as soon as it finds them, so it is easier to debug that compuled code.
------------------------------------------------------

**Compilers:** 
- A compiler translates all the source code at the same time to create the compuled code, or machine code, also know as the object code. 
- The machine code is saved ans stored in a separate file to the high-level programming language.
- Make testing small sections of the program slower as the whole program needs to be compiled before any of it can be run.
- For the developer, compuled code has the advantage that the user of the software cannot see the source code or copy it.

------------------------------------------------------
**Assamblers:**
- An assembler translates assembly language into machine code and is effectively a compiler for the assembly language, but can also be used interactively like an interpreter.
- Assembly language instruction is translated into a single machine code instruction.

### 3.-Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?

- Compiler
- Assemblers
-----------------------------------------------------

## **Platinum** exam questions

## 1.-What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

The compiler can convert high-level language code to machine code in one session. Compilers can take a while, because they have to translate high-level code to lower-level.
The interpreters is another way to get code to run on your processor is to use an interpreter. which is not the same as a compiler. An interpreter translates code like a compiter but reads the code and immediately are often used in software development tools as debugging tools, as they can 
## 2.- What is assembly language?

Assembly is a low-level programming language in which is used to program the machine like microcontroller or PC.

## 3.- A developer is writing a program.
	a) the program is written in a high level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language programs into machine code?
		Machine language, or machine code, is the only language that is directly understood by the computer, and it does not need to be translated. 
high-level language is a programming language that uses English and mathematical symbols, like +, -, % and many others, in its instructions
	b) One type of tanslator is an interpreter.

		I)Describe how an interpreter type of translates high-level language programs into machine code?

		II)State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?
